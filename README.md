Experience the convenience and security of a seamless passwordless authentication solution for servers! Say goodbye to the hassle of managing weak or guessable passwords when it comes to server access.

Here's how the enhanced server authentication route unfolds:

SSH, already fortified by the robust security of 1Password, forms the initial layer of defence against unauthorized access.

Enter Passkeys, powered by Passage, the ultimate passwordless authentication solution. Passkeys revolutionize the way you authenticate yourself to servers. No more remembering or storing passwords manually. Instead, Passkeys use your official computer, phone, or other trusted devices as the medium for authentication.

The power of 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) further strengthens the server authentication process. With Google Authenticator, you can enjoy an additional layer of security that verifies your identity using a time-based OTP (One-Time Password) generated on your trusted device.

By combining SSH, Passkeys, and 2FA, the entire server authentication journey becomes exceptionally robust. And the best part? You no longer need to carry separate devices or tokens to unlock access. Your existing computer or phone becomes the key to seamless and passwordless server authentication.
